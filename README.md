# SCTI source code
Repository for providing access to SCTI source code files. 
Note that the code files are often not adequate for compiling the full executables, because the projects make use of some 3rd party software tools. However, these source code files are provided so that developers can see the algorithms used within the SCTI programs. These code files are copyrighted, but made available for inspection under Creative Commons license.
